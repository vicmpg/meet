Meet App and their user stories and features:
FEATURE 1: FILTER EVENTS BY CITY

As a user, I should be able to filter events by city. So that I can see a list of events taking place in that city.

-Scenario 1: User opens the app and has searched a city.

-Given the main page with search option has been opened, when the user entered a city, then they should be shown upcoming events for that city.

-Scenario 2: User opens the app and hasn't searched a city.

-Given the main page with search option has been opened, when the user opens the app, then they should be shown a list of all events for all the cities available.

-Scenario 3: User can select a city from the suggested list.

-Given user was typing "Berlin" in the city textbox AND the list of suggested cities is showing, when the user selects a city (e.g., "Berlin, Germany") from the list, then their city should be changed to that city (i.e., "Berlin, Germany") AND the user should receive a list of upcoming events in that city.

FEATURE 2: SHOW/HIDE AN EVENT'S DETAILS

As a user I should be able to show or hide event details, after I have selected a city I wanted to look up the events for.

-Scenario 1: An event element is collapsed by default

-Given the user first opens the app when the user recieves the full list of events (specific for the city or all events), then all events will colapse by default.

-Scenario 2: User can expand an event to see its details

-Given the user gets a list of events, when a user selects an event's details, then the details will show up for that choosen event.

-Scenario 3: User can collapse an event to hide its details

-Given the user sees the details of an event, when the user presses a button to hide event's details, then the details of that even will be hidden.

FEATURE 3: SPECIFY NUMBER OF EVENTS

As a user, I should be able to specify the number of displayed events, after I have selected the number of displayed events.

-Scenario 1: When user hasn't specified a number, 32 is the default number.

-Given the user hasn't specified or filtered the number of events, when the user sees the list of events then the default number of displayed events will be 32.

-Scenario 2: User can change the number of events they want to see.

-Given the user has events displayed, when the user chooses to change the number of events displayed, then the number of events displayed will update to the number the user selected.

FEATURE 4: USE THE APP WHEN OFFLINE

As a user, I should be able to get events information when offline, that was fetched while having internet connection.

-Scenario 1: Show cached data when there's no internet connection.

-Given the user has no internet connection, when the user is accessing the app, then cached data, stored inside the app, will be provided to the user.

-Scenario 2: Show error when user changes the settings (city, time range).

-Given the user has no internet connection, when the user is trying to access new event information (change the city, etc.), then the app will show an error.

FEATURE 5: ADD AN APP SHORTCUT TO THE HOME SCREEN

As a user I should be able to add a shortcut of the app to the home screen, so I can access the app quicker.

-Scenario 1: User can install the meet app as a shortcut on their device home screen.

-Given the user wants to install the app, when the user selects to install the app as a shortcut, then a shortcut is created on users homescreen.

FEATURE 6: DISPLAY CHARTS VISUALIZING EVENT DETAILS

As a user, I would like to be able to see a chart showing the upcoming events in each city so that I know what events are organized in which city.

-Scenario 1: Show a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city.

-Given the user is in the events detail page, when the user clicks the button to see a chart of those events in all the cities as a comparison, then a chart with the number of upcoming events for every city, will be shown to the user.

USE OF SERVERLESS FUNCTION IN THE MEET APP

The Meet App can use serverless functions for event notifications, real-time data processing, user authentication, event recommendations, , and scalability. By leveraging serverless technology, the app can efficiently handle backend processes, provide personalized experiences, and scale according to user demand.
